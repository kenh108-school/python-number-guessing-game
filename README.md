# python-number-guessing-game
This is a game written in python where the user must guess a random number. The user enters a positive number as a command line arguement. Any number between and including 0 and this number can be randomly chosen. The user makes guesses until they are correct. After each incorrect guess the user is given a hint, based on whether the number is higher or lower.
